# Traversals

Breezy's thunks work hand-in-hand with PropsTemplate to query your JSON template for nodes. This guide helps you understand how the tools work with each other.

## The bzq param
The `bzq` param is a keypath to nodes in your tree and is used exclusively with the `remote` thunk. On the PropsTemplate side, we pass that param over to an internal node in order to walk your templates.

For example, with a template below.

```ruby
json.data(search: params[:bzq]) do
  json.header do
    json.search do
      # Results is a leaf node
      json.results Post.search(params[:some_search_str])
    end
  end

  json.content do
    json.bar_chart do
       ...bar chart data
    end

    ...
  end

  ...
end
```

To fetch the `json.search` node, we would need to walk to `data` then `header` then `search`. Translating that to a remote call with a `bzq` param:

```
remote('/dashboard?bzq=data.header.search&some_search_str=haircuts')
```

## Collections
There are two ways to query collections. Looking at the following example:

```ruby
json.data(search: params[:bzq]) do
  json.posts do
    json.array! @posts do |post|
      json.details do
        json.title post.title
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Index based selection
You may use an index based key to fetch an item in a list like so:

```
remote('/dashboard?bzq=data.posts.0.details')
```

To enable this functionality, you are required to implement `member_at(index)` on the passed collection.

{% hint style="info" %}
PropsTemplate includes a `Array` extension which delegates to `at`. If you've used the Breezy generators, it will be included in an initializer.
{% endhint %}

While traversing by index works fine, it can lead the wrong post being updated if your Redux state has changed by the time the request comes back.

### Attribute-based selection
Attribute based keys for collections look like this:

```
remote('/dashboard?bzq=data.posts.some_id=1.details')
```

Notice that we're now referencing the collection member by `some_id=1` instead of index. This will fetch the node from the backend and graft it correctly in Redux.

To enable this, you are required to implement `member_by(attribute, value)` on the passed collection AND use the option `:key` in `json.array!`. For example:

```ruby
json.data(search: params[:bzq]) do
  json.posts do
    json.array! @posts, key: :some_id do |post|
      json.details do
        json.title post.title
      end

      # The following will be auto appended by the key: options
      # json.some_id post.some_id
    end
  end
end
```

## Partials

You can even query into partials.

```
remote('/dashboard?bzq=data.posts.some_id=1.details')
```

```ruby
json.data(search: params[:bzq]) do
  json.posts(partial: 'list_of_posts')do
  end
end
```

```ruby
# list_of_posts.json.props
json.array! @posts , key: :some_id do |post|
  json.details do
    json.title post.title
  end

  # The following will be auto appended by the key: options
  # json.some_id post.some_id
end
```

{% hint style="info" %}

When querying, Breezy will disable [caching](https://github.com/thoughtbot/props_template#caching) and [deferement](https://github.com/thoughtbot/props_template#deferment) until the target node is reached.

That's the basics of traversing with Breezy. A lot of modern SPA functionality can be achieved by just a few lines of code. Head over to [recipes](./recipes.md) for examples.
